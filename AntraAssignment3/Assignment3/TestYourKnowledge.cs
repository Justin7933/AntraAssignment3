1.What are the six combinations of access modifier keywords and what do they do?
public, internal, private, private protected, internal protected, protected internal
2.What is the difference between the static, const, and readonly keywords when applied to
a type member?
static is stored in the heap while const is always a const value. Readonly means you cannot modify the value
3.What does a constructor do?
creating an instance the constructor will copy the object
4. Why is the partial keyword useful?
it can split the function of methods and interfaces into other files
5.What is a tuple?
array or list
6.What does the C# record keyword do?
reference type 
7.What does overloading and overriding mean?
overloading two or more methods have the same method but different parameters, overriding is when two methods have both the same
8.What is the difference between a field and a property?
a field is delcared in a class while a property allows the method to, read, write or complete
9.How do you make a method parameter optional?
give a default value
10.What is an interface and how is it different from abstract class?
interface lets you define functionality not implement it while abstract classes allow you to do so
11.What accessibility level are members of an interface?
any six the starting one is public
12.True/False. Polymorphism allows derived classes to provide different implementations
of the same method.
True
13.True/False. The override keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is
providing its own implementation of a method.
True
14.True/False. The new keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is
providing its own implementation of a method.
True
15.True/False. Abstract methods can be used in a normal (non-abstract) class.
False
16.True/False. Normal (non-abstract) methods can be used in an abstract class.
True
17.True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were virtual in the base class.
True
18.True/False. Derived classes can override methods that were abstract in the base class.
True
19.True/False. In a derived class, you can override a method that was neither virtual non abstract in the
base class.
False
20.True/False. A class that implements an interface does not have to provide an implementation for all of the members of the interface.
False
21.True/False. A class that implements an interface is allowed to have other members that aren’t defined in the interface.
True
22.True/False. A class can have more than one base class.
False
23.True/False. A class can implement more than one interface.
True
